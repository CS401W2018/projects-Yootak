        <P>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</P>
        <P>-real life photo with the camera when take a photo. </P>
        <P>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</P>
        <P>-cartoon and logo have not a lot of colors.</P>
        <P>What is unique about the PNG format?</P>
        <P>- cartoon/ transparency. It is also good for cartoons. It has transparency support, so even though the background is the same color, you can still tell through transparency.</P>
        <P>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</P>
        <P>- Make a class and go to css file and by using width or height, you can change the size. Another option open it with the paint app and resize it.</P>
        <P>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </P>
        <P>- if the photo is too big it will take a longer time to download. So if we use the paint app, we are using CPU power to make the photo smaller and shrink the photo volume which will help us to download faster.        </P>
