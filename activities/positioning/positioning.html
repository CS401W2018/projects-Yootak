            <li>What is normal flow in HTML? A normal flow of HTML is the default value at which a block or inline element is displayed on a page. In addition, a normal flow of HTML remain a normal flow unless modified by float, relative, absolute, and fixed in CSS.</li>
            <li>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?The float attribute positions the image to the left or right of the content in p. The reason for clearing a float is that all the contents of the container disappear or cannot be seen when floating, so using clear allows all things in the container to be included and represented.</li>
            <li>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do? Relative moves from its original position when position is specified. Other elements of the page do not fill the remaining space created by the element moved by the relative. Absolute adjusts the position of the element relative to the parent. It is located in the top right of the nearest ancestor. Fixed keeps the element in the same position when the page is scrolled through.</li>
            <li>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices? Absoluted navigation buttons for mobile devices can be used as a hamburger button to save space. It can show the page cleanly or flexibly represent menus when clicking on them.</li>
            <li>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class? You can find it in the Lecture Note in the section you learn this week, More CSS and Box Model.</li>
