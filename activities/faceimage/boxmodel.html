        <div class="boxa">What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</div>
        <div class="boxb">:Block elements naturally take up the full width of their container, while inline elements only occupy as much space as their content requires. 
            Block elements do not share their width, even if extra space is available.</div>
        <div class="boxa">What is the margin, border, and padding?</div>
        <div class="boxb">:The margin represents the space outside an element, the border defines its outline, and the padding is the inner spacing between the content 
            and the border.</div>
        <div class="boxa">What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</div>
        <div class="boxb">:For fonts and text, the pt unit is commonly used, whereas units like px, in, and cm are generally applied for other measurements.</div>
        <div class="boxa">When would you use a figure tag?</div>
        <div class="boxb">:This is utilized to assign media content, such as images or various types of media, along with their respective captions.</div>
