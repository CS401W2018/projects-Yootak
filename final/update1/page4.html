    <h2>Training Tips for a Happy Pup</h2>
    <p>Training your dog is one of the most rewarding parts of dog ownership. Consistent, positive reinforcement helps your dog learn expectations and build trust with you.</p>

      <h3>Basic Commands</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sit:</strong> Hold a treat close to your dog's nose, then move your hand up. As their head follows, their bottom will lower — say "sit" and give the treat.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay:</strong> Once sitting, open your palm in front of their face and say "stay." Take a few steps back and reward if they hold position.</li>
        <li><strong>Potty Training:</strong> Take them out frequently, especially after eating or waking up. Reward immediately after they go outside.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Building Good Habits</h3>
      <p>Start training early and be consistent. Use short, fun sessions and reward desired behaviors with praise or treats. Avoid punishment — redirect instead.</p>

      <h3>Correcting Common Problems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chewing:</strong> Provide chew toys and redirect them when they chew inappropriate things.</li>
        <li><strong>Barking:</strong> Understand the cause — boredom, excitement, or alert — and train with commands like "quiet" with rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Ignore jumping and only give attention when all four paws are on the ground.</li>
      </ul>
