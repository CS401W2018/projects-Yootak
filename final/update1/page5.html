    <h2>My Journey with Mocca</h2>
    <p>Let me introduce you to <strong>Mocca</strong>, a fluffy little Pomeranian who changed my life. When I first adopted Mocca, I had no experience with dogs. I was nervous, unsure, and honestly — a little overwhelmed. But from the first moment she curled up on my lap, I knew we had something special.</p>

      <h3>The First Year</h3>
      <p>The first few months were full of learning. Mocca had endless energy, chewed everything, and needed constant attention. We went through several obedience classes, and I learned to be patient, consistent, and calm.</p>
      <p>One of the best pieces of advice I found was from the <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/potty-training-puppy-tips/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club's training tips</a>. These helped me stay on track and gave Mocca a reliable routine.</p>

      <h3>The Bond We Built</h3>
      <p>Over time, Mocca became my best friend. Whether it was walks in the park, lazy Sundays, or just being there after a long day, she taught me the value of companionship and unconditional love. Dogs don't care if you're having a bad day — they just want to be there with you.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patience pays off:</strong> Training takes time — but it is worth it.</li>
        <li><strong>Routine is key:</strong> Dogs thrive on knowing what to expect.</li>
        <li><strong>Love deeply:</strong> A dog will give back ten times with love.</li>
      </ul>
