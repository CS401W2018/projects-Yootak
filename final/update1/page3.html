      <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Brush your dog regularly, and keep up with nail trimming and ear cleaning.</li>

      <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Spend time training and playing to build trust and love.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Mental Stimulation Matters</h3>
      <p>Dogs need more than just physical activity. Providing puzzle toys, teaching new tricks, and letting them explore new environments helps keep their minds sharp and spirits high. A bored dog can become destructive, so keeping their brain active is just as important as exercise.</p>

      <h3>Consistency Builds Comfort</h3>
      <p>Keeping a consistent routine for feeding, walking, and sleeping helps your dog feel secure. Dogs thrive on predictable schedules and environments. When routines change, try to ease the transition with extra attention and reassurance.</p>

      <h3>Communicating with Your Dog</h3>
      <p>Understanding your dog's body language is key to building trust. Watch for signs like tail wagging, ear position, and posture. Use a calm, confident tone when speaking, and always reward good behavior with praise or treats.</p>
