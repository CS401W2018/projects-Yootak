  <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
  <h2>Name: Yootak Kim</h2>

  <h3>1. Title and Topic</h3>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Happy Dog Life Guide</p>
  <p>
    I chose this topic because I have always loved dogs and believe they are truly part of the family. However, caring for a dog comes with responsibilities that many people may not fully understand. With this website, I want to provide helpful tips and essential information for current and future dog owners. My goal is to promote happy and healthy lives for both dogs and their humans.

  <h3>5. Statement of Understanding</h3>
  <p>
    I have read and understand all the warnings for this project.  
  </p>
  <h3>Warning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You CAN NOT copy and paste any text from another website (especially Wikipedia), except with small quotes with attribution given. You will get an AUTOMATIC F for the final project and presentation if you do.</li>
    <li>You CAN NOT use copyrighted pictures or other information. All pictures must be owned by you or licensed to be used on your site, and attribution must be given if required. You will lose 30 points for each copyrighted picture you use.</li>
    <li>You CAN NOT just copy another site. Your site must be mostly your original work.</li>
    <li>You CAN NOT copy another student's final project or page and change the text. The HTML and CSS must be your own work. Copying HTML and CSS is cheating, and it will result in an automatic F in the course. You will also be turned in to the honor code office.</li>
